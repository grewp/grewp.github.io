			<h3>Brad Pettigrew</h3>
			<p>I’m a versatile Front-End Engineer with two years experience working in web development. As someone
				with a strong understanding of design principles and back-end architecture, I can effectively bridge
				the gap between developers and designers, making me a strong asset to any team and an effective communicator.</p>
			<p>I recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where I received my Bachelors in Mathematics,
				but discovered a love of web development and subsequently honed my skills as a teaching assistant for CIS 197.
				I cut my teeth in development building The Moviegoer and leveraged my technical background to inform design
				decisions through data analysis.</p>
			<p>Currently I am a Product Engineering intern at data.world, working in a cutting edge web stack to develop
				next generation data discovery and collaboration tools.</p>

					<h3>data.world</h3>
					<span>Product Engineering Intern · 06.17-09.17</span>
					<p>data.world is a small startup based out of Austin, Texas building the github for data.
						As an intern for data.world, I’ve become adept in a number of cutting edge technologies,
						including es6/7, functional programming patterns, and sophisticated REST design, and I’ve
						discovered a love for working in small, fast paced teams shipping new features on a weekly basis.</p>
					<p>My largest contribution to the company was the implementation of the Data Inspector, which I developed
						 to completion from the design mocks and data endpoints to completed product. I architected the component
						  using a functional design philosophy so as to have the most robust support for future extensibility
							and carefully integrated the source code with our current type system to optimally support refactoring.
							Additionally, I developed an extensive set of tests using Jest and Enzyme to further support maintainability.
							 Beyond engineering, the feature has added tremendous business value for our current users, which we have
							 found from quick feedback by the community, and which I have evangelized in an article on the team’s engineering blog.</p>
					<div class='imgPlaceholder'></div>
					<p>Additionally, I built a number of other substantial features including a schema filter for our SQL querying
						 tool and a sleek of our file upload dropzone. Notwithstanding features, I also helped the team by fixing
						  cross-compatibility and mobile issues, resolving server-side Sentry errors, and implementing A/B tests – these
							 daily tasks consisted of tightening product polish, which bolstered by technical knowledge and instilled in me
							  a high professional standard.</p>

					<h3>The Moviegoer</h3>
					<span>Front-End Developer, Founder · 08.15-05.17</span>
					<p>The Moviegoer is a student run site I founded, ran, and developed for two years.
						The site itself consists of two aspects: a user facing site and CMS for use by editors.
						In Fall of 2016, I sought to modernize both the site and app with the help of a Back-end engineer.</p>
					<p>I worked with my Back-end engineer to develop a realistic timeline and set of requirements. We
						planned a two-week sprint followed by two weeks of cleanup; he would take the back-end and dev. ops
						responsibilities, while I took front-end and design responsibilities. Each week leading up to and
						throughout the sprint we met to make key design decisions. We chose to use isomorphic React to improve
						site SEO, we integrated AWS Lambda functions into the architecture to optimally resize images, and we
						made sure the restructured API endpoints were consistent with the new site features and navigation I was designing.</p>
					<p>Based on research I had done in the current site’s analytics, I noticed different groups of readers were
						disproportionately engaging with only a subset of the authors on the site. Reasoning that our target audience
						were compelled to read articles more by the social clout of the authors rather than the content, I sought out
						to make the site more personable and use authors as the primary form of site navigation, adding author cards
						to the side of each article which linked back to a dedicate author page as well as adding a prominent author
						page containing all of our writers.</p>
					<div class='imgPlaceholder'></div>
					<p>I implemented this idea from concept to execution building wireframes and subsequently design mocks for each
						page. During the design period, I brought on a graphic designer to assist with the development of site typography,
						specifying not only a system of fonts, but best practice for font sizing, spacing, and coloring to improve readability.
						I then wrote all of the Front-end code in React and CSS with the help of Bourbon Neat’s grid system.  The choice of
						Bourbon Neat over Bootstrap was made because the site’s minimalist design did not necessitate all of the features of
						Bootstrap. Moreover, since the React architecture was selectively rendering articles that were essentially text nodes
						(the images were loaded asynchronously after page load) Bootstrap’s large packet size would have slowed down an otherwise
						snappy technical design.  Finally, in the clean up stages of development I ran informal user tests to make sure the site
						navigation was effective, cross-compatible, and responsive.</p>

					<h3>CIS 197</h3>
					<span>Teaching Assistant · 01.17-05.17</span>
					<div class='content'>
						<p>CIS 197 is a technical elective taught entirely by upperclassmen with practical exposure to the subject matter.
							I took a position as a Teaching Assistant for the class both out of my passion for web development and because I valued
							the beauty in small details – I knew that mastery of the fundamentals is essential to a successful career in software
							development and that teaching was the best way to understand the material deeply.</p>
						<p>I worked with three other teaching assistants to bring the curriculum up to modern standards and gave guest lectures
							in my areas of interest, including project management and d3. I strengthened my debugging skills pair programming with
							students in my weekly office hours and I gained a tremendous amount of experience diffusing unruly architectures for
							students’ final projects ranging in complexity from an online scheduler to a three-dimensional weather visualizer using three.js.</p>
